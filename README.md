### Forecasting Housing Prices with Gradient Boosting

This project aims to forecast housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location (city, urban, rural).
Using a dataset of housing features and their corresponding prices, we created a predictive model using Gradient Boosting Regressor. The location feature was 
converted into dummy variables to enable the model to handle categorical data.The data was split into training and testing sets, and the modelwas trained to 
learn the relationship between the features and housing prices. The model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of approximately 197,415,423.Based on user 
inputs for the house features, the model can predict the estimated price of a house. For instance, a house with 3500 square footage, 9 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, 
located in a rural area, was predicted to be priced around $849,010.58.
